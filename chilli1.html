  <body background ="img.avif"></body>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>1.Bacterial leaf spot</h2>
    <img src="chilli2.jpg"  alt="Disease 1"/>
    
    <p>Bacterial leaf spot is a common and destructive disease that affects chili plants.As the disease progresses, the leaves may wilt, turn necrotic, and eventually fall off, leading to defoliation. Bacterial leaf spot is primarily spread through water splashes, rain, or irrigation, as well as through contaminated tools or plant material. Preventive measures such as crop rotation, sanitation, proper water management, and the application of copper-based sprays can help control the spread of bacterial leaf spot and minimize its impact on chili plants. </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Bacterial leaf spot in chili plants presents as water-soaked spots on the leaves.</li>
          <li> The spots enlarge and develop dark brown or black lesions with yellow halos.</li>
            <li>Infected leaves may wilt, turn necrotic, and eventually fall off, leading to defoliation.</li>
              <li>Bacterial leaf spot spreads through water splashes, rain, irrigation, and contaminated tools or plant material.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice crop rotation to avoid consecutive chili plantings in the same area and reduce the buildup of bacterial populations in the soil.</li>
          <li>Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and destroying infected plant material to prevent the spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li>Avoid overhead irrigation and wetting the leaves, as it promotes bacterial spread; opt for drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants.</li>
              <li>Use copper-based fungicides or bactericides as preventive measures or during the early stages of the disease, following label instructions for proper application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose disease-resistant chili varieties to reduce the risk of bacterial leaf spot infection.</li>
          <li>Provide adequate spacing between chili plants for good air circulation, which can help minimize disease development.</li>
            <li>Monitor plants regularly for early signs of bacterial leaf spot and take prompt action if symptoms are detected.</li>
              <li>Maintain a balanced nutrition program, ensuring proper fertilization, as healthy plants are less susceptible to diseases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Apply organic copper-based fungicides or bactericides as a preventive measure to suppress bacterial leaf spot in chili plants.</li>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.Anthracnose</h2>
    <img src="chilli3.jpeg" alt="Disease 1">
   
    <p>Anthracnose disease is a fungal infection that affects chili plants, causing damage to foliage, stems, and fruit. It is caused by Colletotrichum fungus species and can lead to significant yield loss. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves that turn dark brown or black with concentric rings. Stems may weaken and break, and fruit develops sunken, dark-colored spots that enlarge rapidly. Anthracnose thrives in warm, humid conditions and spreads through water, wind, or contact with infected material. Management involves crop rotation, sanitation, and fungicide use as preventive or curative measures. Good air circulation, proper watering, and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization can create an unfavorable environment for the fungus. Timely detection and intervention are crucial to minimize the impact of anthracnose on chili crops.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Symptoms include dark, water-soaked lesions with a yellow halo on leaves.</li>
          <li>Lesions can enlarge, turn brown or black, and coalesce.</li>
            <li>Fruits develop sunken spots that become brown or black with a cracked texture.</li>
              <li>Stems and petioles can have dark, sunken lesions, causing wilting or dieback.</li>
                <li>Infected flowers wither and die, leading to reduced fruit set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Practice crop rotation to avoid planting chillies in the same area each year.</li>
            <li>Provide adequate spacing between chilli plants for good air circulation.</li>
                <li>Avoid overhead watering; instead, water at the base of plants.</li>
                    <li>Remove and destroy any infected plant debris or fallen leaves.</li>
                        <li>Use clean gardening tools and equipment to prevent spreading the disease.</li>
                            
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Choose chilli varieties that are resistant to anthracnose.</li>
            <li>Practice crop rotation, avoiding planting chillies in the same area for consecutive years.</li>
                <li>  Apply appropriate fungicides or biofungicides as recommended.</li>
                    <li>Provide adequate spacing between plants for good air circulation.</li>
                            <li>Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent disease spread.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Disease-resistant Varieties:</h4>Choose chlli varieties that are resistant to anthracnose. Look for varieties specifically bred to have resistance to this fungal disease..</li>
        <li><h4>Crop Rotation:</h4> Practice crop rotation by avoiding planting chillies or other susceptible plants in the same area for consecutive years. This helps break the disease cycle and reduces the buildup of fungal spores in the soil.</li>
          <li><h4>Proper Plant Spacing and Air Circulation:</h4>  Plant chilles with adequate spacing between plants to allow for good air circulation. This helps reduce humidity and creates an environment less favorable for the development and spread of anthracnose.</li>
             <li><h4>Mulching:</h4> Apply organic mulch, such as straw or shredded leaves, around chilli plants. Mulching helps prevent soil splashing, which can carry fungal spores onto the plants..</li>
               <li><h4>Organic Fertilizers and Soil Amendments:</h4> Use compost and organic fertilizers to promote healthy plant growth. Strong, healthy plants are more resistant to diseases, including anthracnose.</li>

    <h2>3.Fusarium Wilt</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\chilli4.webp" alt="Disease 1"> 
   
    <p>Fusarium wilt is a destructive fungal disease that affects chili plants, causing significant damage to their vascular system. It is caused by various species of the Fusarium fungus, particularly Fusarium oxysporum.  
      The disease spreads through contaminated soil, infected plant debris, and contaminated equipment. It can also be transmitted through infected seeds, which further contribute to its spread. 
      Management strategies for Fusarium wilt include crop rotation with non-host plants, soil solarization to reduce fungal populations, and the use of resistant chili varieties. Fungicide treatments may offer limited control but are not considered a long-term solution. 
      </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Wilting: The affected chilli plants show wilting, starting from the lower leaves and progressing upwards. The leaves become limp and droopy.</li>
           <li>Yellowing: Leaves of infected plants may exhibit yellowing or browning, especially in the lower part of the plant. The yellowing can gradually spread to the upper leaves.</li>
              <li> Stunted Growth: Infected chilli plants experience stunted growth, failing to reach their expected height and size. They appear smaller and less vigorous compared to healthy plants.</li>
                 <li> Vascular Discoloration: When the stems of infected plants are cut open, brown or yellowish-brown discoloration can be observed in the vascular tissue. This discoloration indicates the presence of the Fusarium fungus</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose resistant chilli varieties to Fusarium wilt..</li>
        <li> Avoid planting in infested soil with a history of the disease.</li>
          <li>Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.</li>
            <li>Promptly remove and destroy infected plants, avoiding composting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
        <li>Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.</li>
          <li>Monitor plants regularly and take prompt action at the first signs of Fusarium wilt.</li>
            <li>implement strict sanitation practices, including disinfecting tools and equipment between uses to prevent the spread of the Fusarium fungus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Soil Solarization:</h4> Before planting, cover the soil with clear plastic to trap heat from the sun, effectively sterilizing the soil and reducing Fusarium wilt pathogens.
        </li>
        <li><h4> Biocontrol Agents:</h4> Apply beneficial microorganisms, such as Trichoderma spp., to the soil or as seed treatments. These natural antagonists can suppress the growth of Fusarium fungi.
        </li>
        <li><h4>Compost and Organic Matter:</h4> Incorporate well-aged compost and organic matter into the soil to improve soil health and promote beneficial microbial activity, which can help suppress Fusarium wilt.
        </li>
    </ul>
