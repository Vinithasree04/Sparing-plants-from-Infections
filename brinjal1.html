    <h2>1.Bacterial-Wilt-disease</h2> 
            <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\Bacterial-Wilt-disease.png" alt="Disease 2">
   
   
    <p>Bacterial wilt disease is a serious and highly destructive bacterial infection that affects brinjal (eggplant) plants. It is caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. 
 plant. 
      
      Bacterial wilt spreads through contaminated soil, water, infected plant material, or through insect vectors. The bacteria invade the vascular tissues of the plant, disrupting the flow of water and nutrients, leading to wilting and plant death. 
      
      The disease can persist in the soil for many years, making it challenging to control. Crop rotation with non-host plants and the use of resistant brinjal varieties are essential management strategies. 
      
      
      
       <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The plants may exhibit sudden wilting, with leaves appearing limp and drooping, often affecting one side of the plant initially.</li>
          <li>The leaves may exhibit yellowing or browning, starting from the margins and progressing towards the center of the leaf. The discoloration can be intermittent or continuous.
            </li>
                <li> When the lower stem of an infected plant is cut open, a brownish discoloration may be visible in the vascular tissue. This browning indicates the presence of bacterial infection within the plant's water-conducting vessels.
                </li>
                    <li> As the disease progresses, the entire plant may wilt and eventually die. The rapid decline of affected plants is a characteristic feature of bacterial wilt.</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use disease-free seeds or seedlings</li>
        <li>Crop rotation</li>
        <li>Maintain good sanitation practices by removing and destroying infected plants</li>
        <li> Control weeds in and around the brinjal field</li>
        
     
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select brinjal varieties that are resistant or tolerant to bacterial wilt disease.</li>
        <li> Remove and destroy infected plant debris, including roots, fruits, and infected plants, from the field.</li> 
        <li> Remove weeds regularly, especially those belonging to the Solanaceous family.</li>
        <li>use drip irrigation or other methods that minimize water contact with the foliage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Crop Rotation: </h4> crop rotation by avoiding planting brinjal or other Solanaceous crops in the same area for at least three years. Rotate with non-host crops to reduce the population of bacteria in the soil.
</li>
<li><h4>Soil Solarization:</h4> Before planting, cover the soil with clear plastic to trap heat and raise soil temperatures. This technique helps to kill or suppress the bacterial pathogens present in the soil.
</li>
<li><h4>Sanitation:</h4> Remove and destroy infected plant material to prevent the spread of the bacteria. Practice good garden hygiene by cleaning tools, equipment, and containers thoroughly to minimize contamination.
</li>
<li><h4>Resistant Varieties:</h4> Select brinjal varieties that are resistant or tolerant to bacterial wilt. Consult local agricultural extension services or seed catalogs for recommended resistant varieties.
</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>2.Verticillium wilt</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\verticillium wilt.png" alt="Disease 1">
   
  <p>Verticillium wilt is a destructive fungal disease that affects brinjal (eggplant) plants, caused by the soilborne fungus Verticillium dahliae. 

    The disease initially causes wilting and yellowing of the lower leaves, which gradually spreads upward through the plant. The wilting is often more pronounced during hot weather. 
    
    Verticillium wilt is characterized by the presence of dark streaks in the vascular tissues of the infected plant, which can be observed by cutting through the stem. 
    
    
    Good sanitation practices, such as removing and destroying infected plants and minimizing the movement of</p>
  <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellowing and wilting of leaves, starting from the lower leaves and progressing upwards.</li>
        <li>Browning of vascular tissue in the stem when cut open.</li>
        <li>Leaf chlorosis and necrosis, with patches of pale green or yellow discoloration turning brown or necrotic.</li>
        <li>Stunted growth, reduced vigor, and diminished fruit production.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> Soil sanitation</li>
        <li>Irrigation management</li>
        <li>Soil health management</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive nitrogen</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> rotating with non-host crops can help reduce their population.</li> 
      <li> practice soil solarization by covering the soil with transparent plastic sheets during hot summer months. </li>
       <li>Maintain good soil health and fertility to enhance the brinjal plants' vigor and ability to withstand disease pressure.</li>
       <li>Consult with local agricultural authorities or plant pathologists for approved fungicides and proper application methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>

    <h2>3.Fusarium Wilt</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\brin_ver_wilt.jpg" alt="Disease 1"> 
    <p>Fusarium wilt is a destructive fungal disease in brinjal caused by Fusarium oxysporum. It infects the plant's vascular system, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and eventual plant death.Discoloration in the stem indicates the presence of the fungal infection. It is a soil-borne disease that restricts water and nutrient uptake, causing significant damage to brinjal plants.
    </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Wilting: The affected brinjal plants show wilting, starting from the lower leaves and progressing upwards. The leaves become limp and droopy.</li>
<li>Yellowing: Leaves of infected plants may exhibit yellowing or browning, especially in the lower part of the plant. The yellowing can gradually spread to the upper leaves.
</li>
<li> Stunted Growth: Infected brinjal plants experience stunted growth, failing to reach their expected height and size. They appear smaller and less vigorous compared to healthy plants.
</li>
<li> Vascular Discoloration: When the stems of infected plants are cut open, brown or yellowish-brown discoloration can be observed in the vascular tissue. This discoloration indicates the presence of the Fusarium fungus, which has invaded and disrupted the plant's vascular system.
</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose resistant brinjal varieties to Fusarium wilt..</li>
      <li> Avoid planting in infested soil with a history of the disease.</li>
      <li>Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.</li>
      <li>Promptly remove and destroy infected plants, avoiding composting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
      <li>Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.</li>
