    <ul>
      <li>Orange-yellow Pustules: Infected leaves, stems, and fruits develop raised, powdery orange-yellow pustules on their surfaces.</li>
      <li>Leaf Deformation: Severe infections can cause leaf distortion, curling, and premature defoliation.</li>
      
      <li>Stem Cankers: The fungus may also form cankers on the stems, leading to dieback and reduced vigor of the plant.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Plant Resistant Varieties: Select guava varieties that are resistant or tolerant to Guava Rust.</li>
      <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected plant material, including fallen leaves, fruits, and pruned branches.</li>
      <li>Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Moisture on the foliage promotes the spread of Guava Rust. Use irrigation methods that minimize leaf wetness, such as drip irrigation or soaker hoses.</li>
      <li>Prevent Spread: Avoid movement of infected plant material and equipment between guava orchards or gardens.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fungicides: Chemical fungicides may be used to manage Guava Rust. </li>
      <li>Pruning and Removal: Prune and remove severely infected branches or plant parts to reduce the disease's spread.</li>
      <li>Weed Management: Control weeds, as they can serve as alternative hosts for Guava Rust and contribute to disease spread.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Biological Control:</h4> Explore the use of beneficial microbes, such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma spp., which can help suppress the growth of the rust fungus. These can be applied as foliar sprays or root drenches.</li>
      <li><h4>Copper-Based Products: </h4> Apply copper-based fungicides, such as copper hydroxide or copper sulfate, following label instructions. These can help suppress Guava Rust in organic farming practices.</li>
      <li><h4>Organic Amendments:</h4>  Apply well-decomposed compost or organic matter to improve soil health and enhance plant vigor, which can make plants more resilient to diseases.</li>
