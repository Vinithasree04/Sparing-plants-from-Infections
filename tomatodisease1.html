            <p>
              Tomatoes are probably the most popular vegetable in the home garden. Unfortunately, they are also susceptible to Septoria leaf spot, the most common disease of tomatoes in Connecticut. Caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, this widespread disease is also called Septoria blight. It also includes a discussion of strategies to control and minimize the impact of this disease in backyard plantings.

            </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Small, circular brown spots with dark centers on the leaves.</li>
      <li>Yellowing of the leaves surrounding the spots.</li>
      <li>Affected leaves may develop numerous spots and eventually wither and die.</li>
      <li>Lesions can enlarge and merge, forming larger irregular-shaped spots.</li>
      <li>Lower leaves are usually affected first, with the disease progressing upward.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid planting tomatoes or other Solanaceous crops in the same location for consecutive years. Rotate with non-host plants to break the disease cycle.</li>
      <li>Provide adequate spacing between tomato plants to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and minimize disease spread.</li>
      <li>Water the plants at the base or use drip irrigation to keep the foliage dry. Avoid overhead watering, as wet leaves create a favorable environment for disease development. </li>
      <li> Maintain healthy soil by incorporating organic matter, such as compost, to improve soil structure and enhance plant vigor.</li>
      <li> Monitor tomato plants regularly for early signs of the disease, such as small spots on the leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure proper spacing between plants for good air circulation. </li>
      <li>Practice crop rotation to avoid consecutive plantings of tomatoes in the same area. </li>
      <li>Water at the base of plants to keep foliage dry.</li>
      <li>Prune infected leaves and remove plant debris to minimize disease spread.</li>
      <li>Regularly monitor plants for early signs of disease and take prompt action.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Disease-resistant Varieties:</h4> Choose tomato varieties that are resistant or tolerant to Septoria leaf spot. Check seed catalogs or consult local nurseries for recommended varieties</li>
          <li><h4>Crop Rotation:</h4> Rotate tomato plants with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. Avoid planting tomatoes or other Solanaceous plants in the same area for consecutive years.</li>
            <li><h4>Proper Plant Spacing: </h4> sufficient spacing between tomato plants to promote good air circulation, reducing humidity and creating a less favorable environment for disease development.</li>
               <li><h4>Pruning and Removal of Infected Leaves:</h4> Regularly prune lower branches and remove infected leaves to increase airflow and minimize the spread of the disease. Dispose of the infected plant material away from the garden.</li>
                 <li><h4>Beneficial Insects and Predators: </h4> the presence of beneficial insects and predators, such as ladybugs or lacewings, that can feed on the fungal spores and help control the disease naturally.</li>
    </ul>
