    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\banana 1.jpg" alt="Disease 1">
    <p>
        Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis): Black Sigatoka is a fungal disease that affects the leaves of banana plants. It causes dark brown to black lesions with yellow halos on the leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced fruit quality and yield. Regular fungicide applications and cultural practices like pruning infected leaves and maintaining good air circulation can help control Black Sigatoka.
    </p>
    <p>It's important to note that the severity of Black Sigatoka symptoms can vary depending on factors such as the banana variety, environmental conditions, and the stage of disease progression. Early detection and proper management practices are key to minimizing the impact of Black Sigatoka on banana plants and maximizing fruit production.</p>
 
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaf Spots: The initial symptom of Black Sigatoka is the appearance of small, dark brown to black spots on the lower surface of the oldest leaves. </li>
      <li>Lesion Enlargement: As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge and coalesce, forming larger lesions. The lesions typically have a yellow halo or margin surrounding the dark center.</li>
      <li>Defoliation: Black Sigatoka can lead to significant defoliation, where infected leaves become dry, brittle, and eventually drop prematurely from the plant. Severe defoliation can impact the plant's photosynthetic capacity and overall growth.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Disease-Free Planting Material: Start with disease-free banana planting material from a reputable source.</li>
      <li>Proper Spacing and Air Circulation: Plant banana plants at appropriate distances to allow for good air circulation. Dense plantings can create a favorable environment for disease development.</li>
      <li>Irrigation Management: Avoid overwatering or using overhead irrigation methods that keep the leaves wet for extended periods.</li>
      <li>Fungicide Application: Regular and timely fungicide applications are essential to control Black Sigatoka.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>

    <h2>2.Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV)</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\banana 2.jpg"alt="Disease 2">
    <p>
        Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV): BBTV is a viral disease transmitted by banana aphids and affects the entire banana plant. Symptoms include stunted growth, deformed leaves, and the characteristic "bunchy top" appearance of the plant. There is no cure for BBTV, and affected plants should be promptly removed and destroyed to prevent further spread. Using disease-free planting material and controlling aphids can help prevent the disease.
    </p>
    <p>It's crucial to note that there is currently no cure for Banana Bunchy Top Virus. Therefore, prevention and management practices are vital to minimize its impact on banana plantations. Consult with local agricultural authorities, extension services, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations tailored to your region and prevailing conditions.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stunted Growth: Infected plants exhibit stunted growth, resulting in smaller and shorter plants compared to healthy ones. This stunting is one of the key characteristics of BBTV.

    </li>
      <li>Chlorosis and Yellowing: Infected leaves may display chlorosis, which is the yellowing or lightening of the leaf color. </li>
      <li>Bunched or Twisted Leaves</li>
      <li>Necrosis and Drying: In severe cases, infected leaves may show necrosis, which is the death of tissue.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Monitor and Inspect Plants Regularly: Conduct regular inspections of your banana plantation to identify any plants showing symptoms of BBTV. </li>
      <li>Remove and Destroy Infected Plants: If you detect any plants with symptoms of BBTV, promptly remove and destroy them.</li>
      <li>Practice Good Sanitation: Maintain good sanitation practices in your plantation.</li>
      <li>Control Aphid Vectors: Aphids, particularly the banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa), are the primary vectors of BBTV. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain Good Vector Control: Implement effective measures to control the primary vector of BBTV, the banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa). </li>
      <li>Implement Cultural Practices: Optimize cultural practices to promote plant health and reduce stress, which can make plants more susceptible to BBTV.</li>
      <li>Seek Professional Advice: Consult with local agricultural authorities, extension services, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations and guidance on BBTV management in your region. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Cultural Practices:</h4>Plant Resistant Varieties: Choose banana varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to BBTV.</li>
      <li><h4>Biological Control:</h4>:Beneficial Insects: Encourage the presence of natural enemies of aphids, such as ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, by providing suitable habitats and avoiding the use of broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm beneficial insects. </li>
      <li><h4>Community Approach:</h4> : Coordinate with neighboring farmers: Collaborate with other banana growers in your area to implement collective measures for BBTV management. This can include synchronized removal of infected plants, coordinated aphid control, and shared information on disease management strategies.</li>
