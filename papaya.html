    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\papaya 1.jpg" alt="Disease 1">
    <p>
        Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV): PRSV is a devastating viral disease that affects papaya plants. It causes mosaic patterns, yellowing, leaf distortion, and fruit deformities. Infected plants may have reduced fruit yield and quality. Planting virus-resistant papaya varieties is an effective strategy for managing this disease.
    </p>
    <p>It's important to note that genetically modified papaya varieties with resistance to PRSV have been successful in controlling the disease in many regions. However, the cultivation and use of genetically modified crops may be subject to regulations and restrictions depending on the country or region. Therefore, it is advisable to check with local agricultural authorities or extension services for guidance on the availability and use of disease-resistant papaya varieties in your area.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><B>Ringspots:</B> The virus causes the appearance of circular or irregular ringspots on the leaves. These ringspots can vary in color, ranging from light or dark green to yellow or brown. The spots may be distinct or merge together, forming larger irregular patterns on the leaves.</li>
      <li><b>Mosaic Patterns:</b> Another common symptom of PRSV infection is the development of mosaic patterns on the leaves. Mosaic patterns are characterized by alternating light and dark areas on the leaf surface, creating a mottled appearance.</li>
      <li><b>Leaf Deformation:</b> PRSV-infected papaya plants often exhibit leaf deformation. The leaves may become distorted, wrinkled, or crinkled in appearance. They can also be smaller in size compared to healthy leaves. </li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Virus-Resistant Varieties: Plant virus-resistant papaya varieties, such as the genetically modified varieties Rainbow and SunUp, which have shown resistance to PRSV. </li>

    <h2>2.Phytophthora Fruit Rot (Phytophthora palmivora)</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\papaya 2.jpg" alt="Disease 2">
    <p>
        Phytophthora Fruit Rot (Phytophthora palmivora): Phytophthora fruit rot is a destructive fungal disease that affects papaya fruits, causing soft rot and decay. It thrives in wet and humid conditions. Proper drainage, avoiding overwatering, and the use of fungicides can help manage this disease.
    </p>
    <p>It's important to note that Phytophthora palmivora is a complex pathogen with multiple host ranges. Therefore, if Phytophthora Fruit Rot is a concern in your area, it's advisable to consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your region and crop.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Soft Rot: Infected fruits develop a soft, watery rot, often starting at the stem end or wounds on the fruit.</li>
      <li>Dark Spots: Small, dark spots may appear on the surface of the fruit, which gradually enlarge and become water-soaked.</li>
      <li>Foul Odor: The affected fruits emit a foul odor as they decay.</li>
      <li>Spore Production: Under humid conditions, the pathogen may produce white, cottony masses of spores on the surface of infected fruits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Site Selection: Choose a well-drained location for planting your papaya trees.  </li>
      <li>Proper Irrigation: Implement appropriate irrigation practices to prevent excessive moisture around the base of plants and on the fruit.</li>
      <li>Planting Material: Start with disease-free papaya seedlings or seeds obtained from reputable sources.</li>
      <li>Avoid Wounding: Minimize fruit and tree damage during handling, pruning, and harvesting activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mulching: Apply organic mulch around the base of papaya trees to help conserve soil moisture and reduce the splash effect of rain or irrigation water that can potentially spread the pathogen. </li>
