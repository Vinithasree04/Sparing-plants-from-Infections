  <h1>CABBAGE PLANT DISEASES</h1>
  <body background ="img.avif"></body>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>1.BLACK ROT</h2> 
            <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\blackrotcabbage.jpg" alt="Disease 2">
            <p>Black rot disease is a highly destructive bacterial disease that affects cabbage plants. It is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. 
            black rot disease is highly contagious and can spread through contaminated seeds, infected transplants, or infected debris. It thrives in warm and humid conditions. Implementing strict sanitation practices, using disease-free seeds, practicing crop rotation, and removing and destroying infected plants can help manage and prevent the spread of black rot in cabbage crops.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>V-shaped yellow lesions expanding to brown or black.</li>
         <li> Wilting and collapsing leaves.</li>
           <li>Vascular discoloration.</li>
             <li>Overall plant decline and reduced yield.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>make sure to use healthy seeds from cerified sources.</li>
            <li> plant resistant varities and avoid growing susceptible ones in the rainy season.</li> 
                <li> Do not clip transplants because they are oversized</li>
                    <li>provide the fields with good drainage and plant on raised beds</li>
                       <li>Do not grow cabbage in fields that had broccolli,cauliflower,kale or any other member of the brassica family for the previous 3 years</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>A hot water bath for 30 min at 50Â°C is the recommended treatment to sterilize the seeding material. This is not 100 percent effective against black rot but reduces the incidents of the disease considerably
      </p>
      <li><h3>Crop Rotation:</h3> Practice crop rotation by avoiding planting cabbage or other brassica crops in the same area for several years. This helps reduce the buildup of the black rot bacterium in the soil.</li>
        <li><h3>Sanitation:</h3> Remove and destroy infected plant debris, including leaves, stems, and roots, to prevent the spread of the disease. Properly dispose of or compost infected material away from the garden.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>2.DOWNY MILDEW</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\powdery-mildew-300x200.webp" alt="Disease 1">
   <p>Downy mildew is a type of oomycetes or water mold. Once considered a fungal disease, it is now classified in the family Peronosporaceae. There are thousands of different types of water molds, most of which are called downy mildew. Most specialize in a particular species or a group of plants. They are a significant cause of plant pathology.
</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow or pale green patches on upper leaf surface.</li>
          <li> Fuzzy grayish-purple growth on lower leaf surface.</li>
             <li>Leaf curling.</li>
                <li> Eventual defoliation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prune or stake plants and remove any weeds to improve air circulation.</li>
        <li>Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give the plants time to dry out during the day.</li>
          <li>Keep the ground under infected plants clean during the fall and winter to prevent the disease from spreading.</li>
            <li>Remove and destroy any plants with serious infection </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Choose cabbage varieties that are resistant or tolerant to downy mildew. Consult with local agricultural experts or seed suppliers for recommended resistant varieties.</li>
            <li> Apply organic or approved fungicides following recommended application timings to help manage downy mildew. Follow the instructions and safety guidelines provided by the product manufacturer.</li>
               <li> Regularly inspect cabbage plants for early signs of downy mildew. Monitor weather conditions and be proactive in applying control measures when conditions are favorable for disease development.</li>
                  <li> Properly space cabbage plants to allow for better air circulation, which can help reduce humidity and prevent the spread of downy mildew. Prune or remove nearby vegetation that may impede airflow.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li> Rotate out of crucifers for at least two years and avoid planting adjacent to a field infected the previous season.</li>
       <li>Manage for cruciferous weeds (wild mustards, etc.) and volunteers that may harbor this microorganism during rotations.</li>
          <li>Remove or bury infected crop debris in the vicinity of new plantings.</li>
            <li>Manage irrigation to reduce periods of high humidity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.CLUB ROOT</h2>
    <img src="clubroot.jpg"alt="Disease 1"> 
   
    <p>Clubroot is a soil-borne disease that affects cabbage and other brassica plants. It is caused by the pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease is characterized by the development of swollen, distorted, and misshapen roots, giving them a "club" or "gall" appearance. Infected plants exhibit stunted growth, with smaller leaves and reduced overall vigor. Leaves may turn yellow and wilt, especially in hot and dry conditions. Clubroot can also lead to the failure of head formation or the production of small, underdeveloped heads in cabbage crops. The disease spreads through contaminated soil, water, and tools. </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Swollen, distorted roots: Infected plants develop enlarged, club-like roots that are often misshapen and have a knobby appearance.
</li>
<li>Stunted growth: The affected plants exhibit reduced growth and overall stunting, resulting in smaller leaves and limited head development.
</li>
<li>Yellowing and wilting: Infected plants may display yellowing or wilting of leaves, particularly during hot and dry periods.
</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Crop Rotation:Avoid planting brassica crops, including cabbage, in the same area for several years to break the disease cycle. Rotate with non-host crops to minimize the buildup of clubroot pathogens in the soil.</li>
<li>Soil pH Adjustment:Maintain a slightly acidic soil pH (around 6.0-6.5) as clubroot thrives in alkaline soil. Test the soil regularly and amend it if necessary to create a less favorable environment for the pathogen.</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Regularly test the soil pH and maintain it slightly acidic (around 6.0-6.5) to discourage clubroot development. Adjust the pH if necessary using organic amendments like elemental sulfur.
      </li>
<li> Consider using raised beds or containers with fresh, disease-free soil to grow cabbage plants. This can help limit the exposure to clubroot-infested soil and reduce the risk of infection.
</li>
<li> Practice good garden hygiene by removing and destroying any infected plant material, including roots and debris. Avoid transferring soil or contaminated tools to unaffected areas.
</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li><h3> Soil Sterilization:</h3> Solarize the soil by covering it with clear plastic during hot weather to raise temperatures and kill clubroot pathogens. This method helps to reduce the pathogen population in the soil.
       </li>
<li><h3>Biological Control:</h3> Apply beneficial soil microbes, such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma species, which can help suppress the clubroot pathogen. Use these as soil drenches or incorporate them into the soil before planting.
</li>
<li><h3>Resistant Varieties:</h3> Choose clubroot-resistant cabbage varieties when available. These varieties have been bred to withstand the disease and can greatly reduce the impact of clubroot on your crops.
</li>    
        </ul>
