     <body background ="img.avif"></body>
     <div class="section">
       <h2>1.Phytophthora Blight</h2> 
               <img src="capsicum1.jpeg" alt="Disease 2">
       
       <p>Phytophthora Blight, caused by the pathogen Phytophthora capsici, is a destructive disease that affects capsicum (bell pepper) plants. It is characterized by water-soaked lesions that appear on the fruits, stems, and leaves. The lesions gradually expand, turn dark-colored, and result in rotting, leading to plant death. The disease spreads rapidly in warm and wet conditions, primarily through water splashes, contaminated soil, or infected plant debris. Phytophthora Blight can cause significant yield loss and economic damage to capsicum crops. Implementing proper management strategies, including crop rotation, drainage improvement, fungicide applications, and removal of infected plants, is crucial for controlling the spread of Phytophthora Blight and preserving the health of capsicum plants.</p>

       <h2>2.Powdery mildew</h2>
       <img src="capsicum2.jpeg" alt="Disease 1">
      
       <p>Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that commonly affects a wide range of plants, including capsicum (bell pepper). It is characterized by the appearance of a white, powdery growth on the leaves, stems, and fruits of affected plants. The fungal growth inhibits photosynthesis and can lead to leaf curling, yellowing, and premature defoliation. Powdery mildew thrives in warm and dry conditions, spreading through airborne spores. Implementing proper cultural practices, such as maintaining adequate plant spacing, providing good air circulation, and applying fungicidal treatments, can help manage powdery mildew and preserve the health of capsicum plants.</p>
       <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li> White, powdery fungal growth appears on the leaves, stems, and fruits of capsicum plants.</li>
