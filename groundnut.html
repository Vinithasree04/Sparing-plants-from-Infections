  <h1>GROUNDNUT DISEASES</h1>
  <body background ="img.avif"></body>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>1.Early leaf spot</h2>
    <img src="gn1.jpg">
    <p>
       Early leaf spot is a fungal disease that affects groundnuts. It typically appears as circular spots with a brown or reddish-brown center and a yellow halo on the leaves. If left untreated, it can spread to other parts of the plant, such as stems and pods, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.
    </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Circular to irregular spots with a dark brown to black coloration form on the leaves.</li>
<li>The spots may have a reddish-brown border and a grayish-white center.</li>
<li>Similar to early leaf spot, the spots may merge, resulting in larger necrotic areas on the leaves.</li>
<li>Infected leaves can experience defoliation, leading to reduced plant vigor and decreased yield.</li>
      
     
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Resistant Varieties</li>
<li>crop rotation</li>
      <li>pre mature leaf senescence</li>
<li>Yellow Halos</li>
<li>Lesion Distribution</li>
<li>Grayish-Brown Lesions</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant groundnuts at the appropriate time, considering the local climate and growing conditions. </li>
 <li> Practice good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris, including infected leaves and plant residues. Th</li>
 <li>When necessary and appropriate, apply fungicides following recommended guidelines and timings.</li>
 <li>Conduct regular scouting and monitoring of groundnut plants for early leaf spot symptoms.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Seaweed extract: </h4>Seaweed extract is derived from various seaweed species and contains trace minerals, growth hormones, and other beneficial compounds. It enhances plant growth, stimulates root development, and improves plant resistance to stress. </li>
      <li> <h4>Green Manure:</h4> Green manure involves growing specific leguminous plants, such as cowpea or pigeon pea, and then incorporating them into the soil as a fertilizer. </li>
      <li><h4>Farmyard Manure (FYM):</h4> Farmyard manure, also known as animal manure, is a traditional organic fertilizer obtained from livestock waste, such as cow dung or poultry droppings. It is rich in organic matter and nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. </li>
<li><h4>Cover crops:</h4> Planting cover crops, such as legumes (e.g., clover, vetch) or grasses (e.g., rye, oats), can enrich the soil with nitrogen through biological nitrogen fixation. These cover crops can be incorporated into the soil as green manure, adding organic matter and nutrients</li>
<li><h4>Bone Meal:</h4> Bone meal is a high-nitrogen organic fertilizer derived from dried animal blood. It provides an immediate nitrogen boost to plants, promoting leaf development and overall growth.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.Late leaf spot</h2>
    <img src="gn2.jpg">
    <p>
         Late leaf spot is another fungal disease that affects groundnuts. It causes similar symptoms to early leaf spot, with circular spots on the leaves. However, late leaf spot spots tend to be larger and have a dark brown to black color. Like early leaf spot, if left untreated, it can result in defoliation and reduced yield.
    </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Circular to irregular spots with a dark brown to black coloration form on the leaves.</li>
<li>The spots may have a reddish-brown border and a grayish-white center.</li>
<li>Similar to early leaf spot, the spots may merge, resulting in larger necrotic areas on the leaves.</li>
<li>Infected leaves can experience defoliation, leading to reduced plant vigor and decreased yield.</li>

      
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice crop rotation by avoiding planting groundnuts or other susceptible crops in the same field consecutively. </li>
      <li>Select and plant groundnut varieties that are known to have resistance or tolerance to late leaf spot disease.</li>
      <li>Start with high-quality, certified disease-free seeds. This helps reduce the introduction of pathogens into the field and ensures a healthier crop.</li>
<li>Plant groundnuts at the appropriate time, considering the local climate and growing conditions.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Stay informed about local weather conditions, disease outbreaks, and pest pressure by utilizing disease forecasting models and monitoring systems.</li>
<li> Implement cultural practices that promote plant health and reduce disease susceptibility.</li>
<li>Proper irrigation practices can help minimize disease development. </li>
<li>Maintain good airflow within the crop canopy by avoiding excessive plant density and ensuring proper plant spacing. </li>
<li>Explore the use of beneficial microorganisms or biocontrol agents that can help suppress late leaf spot disease.</li>


      
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Compost: </h4>Compost is a nutrient-rich organic matter that improves soil structure, fertility, and microbial activity. It provides a slow release of nutrients and enhances the overall health of the soil,  </li>
<li><h4>Manure:</h4> Well-composted animal manure, such as cow, horse, or poultry manure, is a valuable source of organic matter, nitrogen, and other essential nutrients. It enriches the soil, promotes beneficial microbial activity, and enhances plant growth and health. </li>
<li><h4>Fish emulsion:</h4> Fish emulsion is a liquid organic fertilizer made from fish byproducts. It is a good source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace elements. Fish emulsion can be applied as a foliar spray or incorporated into the soil to provide necessary nutrients for plant growth and development. </li>
<li><h4>Regular field inspections:</h4> Conduct regular field inspections to monitor the presence and progression of late leaf spot disease. Look for characteristic symptoms on leaves, stems, and pods. Early detection allows for prompt action and management interventions. </li>
 
    </ul>

    <h2>3.Peanut smut</h2>
    <img src="gn3.jpg"> 
    <p>
 Peanut smut is a fungal disease that affects groundnuts. It is caused by the fungus Thecaphora frezii. The disease primarily affects the pods, causing them to develop black, powdery masses instead of normal kernels. These masses contain fungal spores, which can spread to healthy plants. Peanut smut can significantly reduce the quality and marketability of the harvested groundnuts.
    </p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
     
 <li> Infected peanut pods develop black, powdery masses instead of normal kernels. </li>
 <li> These masses are composed of fungal spores. The smut spores replace the normal seeds inside the pod.</li>
<li>Infected pods may become enlarged and distorted compared to healthy pods.</li>
<li>The smut masses can cause the pods to swell and take on an irregular shape.</li>
<li>The pod wall may become weakened and eventually disintegrate due to the presence of smut masses. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with certified disease-free seeds obtained from reputable sources. Ensure that the seeds are free from any signs of infection or contamination.</li>
 <li>Practice crop rotation by avoiding planting groundnuts or other susceptible crops in the same field consecutively.</li>
 <li>: Practice good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris, including infected pods, plant residues, and any volunteer plants. </li>
 <li>Treat the seeds with appropriate fungicides or biological agents to prevent the transmission of smut spores from the seeds to the developing plants. </li>
 <li>Conduct regular field inspections to monitor the development of peanut smut.</li>


      
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant groundnut varieties that have shown resistance or tolerance to peanut smut. </li>
  <li>Ensure proper soil preparation before planting. This includes adequate soil drainage, proper pH levels, and optimal soil fertility. </li>
  <li> Implement a crop rotation system that includes non-host crops to break the disease cycle and reduce the buildup of smut spores in the soil. </li>
  <li>Treat groundnut seeds with appropriate fungicides or biological agents before planting to reduce the transmission of smut spores from seeds to developing plants.</li>
  <li>Practice good field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris, including infected pods and plant residues. </li>
