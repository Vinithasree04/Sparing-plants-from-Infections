      <p>Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that commonly affects a wide range of plants, including capsicum (bell pepper). It is characterized by the appearance of a white, powdery growth on the leaves, stems, and fruits of affected plants. The fungal growth inhibits photosynthesis and can lead to leaf curling, yellowing, and premature defoliation. Powdery mildew thrives in warm and dry conditions, spreading through airborne spores. Implementing proper cultural practices, such as maintaining adequate plant spacing, providing good air circulation, and applying fungicidal treatments, can help manage powdery mildew and preserve the health of capsicum plants.</p>
      <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
      <ul>
       <li> White, powdery fungal growth appears on the leaves, stems, and fruits of capsicum plants.</li>
          <li> Infected leaves may exhibit curling, distortion, and yellowing.</li>
             <li>Powdery mildew can cause premature defoliation, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.</li>
                <li>The disease thrives in warm and dry conditions, spreading through airborne spores.</li>
                   <li>Fungal growth inhibits plant growth and can impact the overall health and vigor of capsicum plants.</li>
       </ul>
      <h3>Precautions:</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Provide adequate spacing between capsicum plants for proper air circulation and reduce the risk of powdery mildew.</li>
         <li> Avoid overhead irrigation and instead water at the base of the plants to minimize humidity and moisture on the foliage.</li>
           <li>Remove and destroy infected plant parts promptly to prevent the spread of powdery mildew.</li>
             <li>Apply organic fungicides or botanical sprays, such as neem oil or sulfur, as preventive measures or at the first sign of powdery mildew, following label instructions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Choose powdery mildew-resistant capsicum varieties to minimize the risk of infection.</li>
         <li>Regularly monitor plants for early signs of powdery mildew and take immediate action if detected.</li>
           <li> Improve air circulation by pruning dense foliage and maintaining proper plant spacing.</li>
             <li>Apply preventive treatments, such as foliar sprays with baking soda or horticultural oil, to protect plants from powdery mildew.</li>
               <li>Practice good garden hygiene by cleaning up fallen leaves and debris to reduce overwintering spores and disease pressure.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Apply organic fungicides like sulfur or potassium bicarbonate to control powdery mildew organically.</li>
          <li>Use neem oil or other botanical extracts with antifungal properties to suppress powdery mildew growth.</li>
            <li>Apply a foliar spray of milk solution (diluted with water) as a natural remedy to prevent and manage powdery mildew.</li>
              <li>Enhance plant immunity through organic amendments, such as compost or seaweed extract, to help plants resist powdery mildew.</li>
                <li>Encourage natural predators and beneficial organisms, such as ladybugs or predatory fungi, to control powdery mildew populations in the garden.</li>
      </ul>
