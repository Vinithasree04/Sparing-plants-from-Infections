  <body background ="img.avif"></body>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>1.Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) </h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\mango 1.jpg" alt="Disease 1">
    <p>
      Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides): This fungal disease causes dark, sunken lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruits of mango trees.<br> Infected fruits may develop black, necrotic spots that can lead to fruit rot and decay.
    </p>
    <p>Prevention and control measures for mango diseases include practicing good sanitation, such as removing and destroying infected plant parts, promoting good air circulation through proper pruning, and providing adequate spacing between trees. Fungicides or bactericides may be used as a preventive measure or as directed by a professional based on specific disease management programs. It's important to consult with a local agricultural extension service or horticulturist for specific guidance on managing mango diseases in your region, as the severity and prevalence of diseases can vary.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaf Lesions: Anthracnose can cause dark, sunken lesions on mango leaves.</li>
      <li>Twig Dieback: Anthracnose can lead to dieback of young twigs and branches.</li>
      <li>Fruit Lesions: One of the most significant impacts of anthracnose is on mango fruits. </li>
      <li>Fruit Rot: As the lesions expand, the infected mango fruits can start rotting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy any fallen leaves</li>
      <li>Pruning: Prune mango trees to promote good air circulation and sunlight penetration into the canopy</li>
      <li>Water Management</li>
      <li>Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the mango tree to prevent soil splashing onto the lower trunk and leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure proper spacing between mango trees to promote good air circulation and reduce humidity levels. </li>
      <li> Consider planting mango varieties that have shown resistance to anthracnose.<br> These varieties are less susceptible to the disease and can help minimize the impact. </li>
      <li>Remove and destroy fallen leaves, twigs, and infected fruit to reduce the source of inoculum. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Neem Oil:</h4>Neem oil has antifungal properties and can be effective against black spot disease. Dilute it according to the instructions and apply it to the affected areas.</li>
      <li><h4>Biostimulants:</h4>Use organic biostimulants, such as seaweed extracts or compost tea, to enhance the overall health and vigor of mango trees.</li>
      <li><h4>Beneficial Microorganisms:</h4>Some beneficial microorganisms, such as Trichoderma spp., have shown potential for suppressing anthracnose.<br>These microorganisms can be applied as a soil drench or foliar spray to help inhibit the growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.</li>
      <li><h4>Beneficial Insects:</h4>Encourage the presence of beneficial insects in your mango orchard, as they can help control pests that may indirectly contribute to disease development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.Mango Scab (Elsinoe mangiferae)</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\FOLDERS\MINI PROJECT\mango 2.jpg" alt="Disease 2">
    <p>
        Mango Scab (Elsinoe mangiferae): Mango scab is a fungal disease that causes scaly, raised lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruits of mango trees. Severe infections can lead to fruit drop and reduce fruit quality.
    </p>
    <p>It's important to note that the severity of mango scab symptoms can vary depending on factors such as the mango variety, environmental conditions, and the level of fungal infection. Early detection and management are key to minimizing the impact of mango scab on tree health and fruit quality.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lesions on Leaves</li>
      <li>Lesions on fruit</li>
      <li>Leaf Deformation</li>
      <li>Premature Leaf Drop</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Site Selection: Choose a well-drained location for planting mango trees. </li>
      <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: Select mango tree varieties that are known to have some level of resistance or tolerance to mango scab. </li>
      <li>Pruning and Thinning: Prune and thin out the mango tree canopy to improve air movement and light penetration.</li>
      <li>Sanitation: Practice good sanitation by removing and destroying fallen leaves, infected fruit, and any other infected plant material.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prune Infected Plant Parts: Prune and remove any infected branches, leaves, or fruits as soon as you notice symptoms of mango scab. </li>
      <li>Improve Air Circulation: Ensure proper spacing between mango trees to promote good air circulation. </li>
      <li> Timely Harvest: Harvest mango fruits at the appropriate maturity stage. Ripe or overripe fruits are more susceptible to mango scab infection. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Sulfur-Based Fungicides:</h4>Sulfur-based fungicides, such as elemental sulfur or sulfur dust, can also be used as organic control options for mango scab. They work by inhibiting the growth of the fungus. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper application rates and timing.</li>
      <li><h4>Neem oil:</h4> Neem oil is a natural product derived from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and has antifungal properties. It can be effective against mango scab when applied as a foliar spray. Follow the instructions on the neem oil product for proper dilution and application rates. </li>
      <li><h4>Regular Monitoring:</h4>  Monitor the mango trees regularly for signs of mango scab. Early detection allows for prompt intervention and better control. Regularly inspect leaves, stems, and fruits for lesions and other symptoms.</li>
