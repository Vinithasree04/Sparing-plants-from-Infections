  <div class="section">
    <h2>1.Black canker</h2>
    <img src="Blackcanker.jpg" alt="Disease 1">

    <p>Black canker is a fungal disease that can affect various fruit trees, including custard apple trees. However, it is not a commonly reported disease in custard apple specifically. Black canker is primarily associated with species of the genus Leucostoma and affects trees that are under stress or have been injured. Here is some general information about black canker.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the management of black canker may vary depending on the specific fungal species causing the disease and the host plant involved. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with local agricultural experts, extension services, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations tailored to your region and the severity of the disease. They can provide guidance on appropriate control measures, including the use of fungicides if necessary, in accordance with local regulations and best management practices.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Canker Lesions: Infected trees develop dark, sunken lesions on the branches, trunk, or stems.</li>
      <li>Cracked Bark: The bark around the cankered areas may crack or split, exposing the underlying wood.</li>
      <li>Gumming: In some cases, the cankers may ooze a gummy substance, which can be observed as resin or gum exuding from the affected areas.</li>
      <li>Dieback: Severe infections can lead to branch dieback or even the death of the entire tree, especially if the cankers girdle the trunk.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected plant material, including cankered branches or trees, to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
      <li>Pruning: Prune affected branches several inches below the visible canker, making sure to sterilize pruning tools between cuts to prevent further spread.</li>
      <li>Avoid Injuries: Minimize tree injuries by practicing careful cultivation and avoiding mechanical damage to the trunk and branches.</li>
      <li>Cultural Practices: Implement good cultural practices to maintain the overall health of the custard apple tree. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pruning: Prune affected branches several inches below the visible canker, cutting back to healthy wood.</li>
      <li>Fungicides: In severe cases or when the disease is widespread, fungicides may be necessary.</li>
      <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: When available, consider planting custard apple varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to black canker. This can help reduce the risk of infection and severity of the disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Crop Rotation: </h4> If possible, practice crop rotation by avoiding planting custard apple trees in the same location year after year. This helps disrupt the disease cycle and reduce the buildup of pathogens in the soil.</li>
      <li><h4>Biological Control: </h4>: Explore the use of beneficial microorganisms or biocontrol agents that can suppress the growth of the black canker fungus. Some beneficial fungi, such as Trichoderma spp., have shown potential in controlling canker-causing pathogens. These biocontrol agents can be applied as sprays or incorporated into the soil according to the manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li><h4>Enhance Plant Defense: </h4>Boost the natural defenses of the custard apple tree by applying organic fertilizers, compost, and other soil amendments that promote healthy root development and overall plant vigor. Strengthening the plant's immune system can help it better resist and recover from diseases.

    <h2>2.Diplodia rot</h2>
    <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-fruit-crops/ipm-strategies-for-custard-apple/Diplodiarot.jpg" alt="Disease 2">
    <p>
        Diplodia rot, also known as Diplodia fruit rot or Diplodia stem-end rot, is a fungal disease that affects various fruit trees, including custard apples. It is caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata. Here are some key points about Diplodia rot.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that specific recommendations and organic control measures may vary depending on your location and the regulations in your area. Consulting with local agricultural experts or extension services will provide tailored recommendations based on the specific conditions and management practices of your custard apple orchard.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fruit Rot: The disease primarily affects the fruit, causing brown or black necrotic lesions. These lesions may initially appear water-soaked and later become sunken and dry, with a corky texture. The rot typically starts at the stem end of the fruit and spreads inward.</li>
      <li>Stem-End Rot: In some cases, the infection can also affect the stem end of the fruit, causing a brown discoloration and decay.</li>
      
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected fruit or plant debris to reduce the source of inoculum. Properly dispose of the infected material away from the orchard.</li>
      <li>Pruning: Prune affected branches and stems, cutting back to healthy wood. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the fungus.</li>
      <li>Fungicide Application: In severe cases or when other control measures are not sufficient, consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for appropriate fungicide recommendations.</li>
      <li>Irrigation Management: Avoid overwatering and ensure proper drainage to prevent excessive moisture around the base of the trees, as this can create a conducive environment for fungal growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fruit Handling: Handle fruit with care to avoid bruising or injuring the skin, as wounds provide entry points for the Diplodia fungus. Harvest fruit when they are mature but still firm to minimize damage.</li>
      <li>Orchard Hygiene: Keep the orchard clean and free of weeds, as they can harbor the Diplodia fungus. Regularly remove weeds and maintain a clean environment around the trees.</li>
      <li>Cultural Practices: Implement good cultural practices to promote overall tree health. This includes proper irrigation management, avoiding overwatering, and ensuring adequate drainage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Organic Control:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Mulching:</h4>Apply organic mulch around the base of the trees to conserve moisture, suppress weed growth, and maintain a more stable soil temperature.</li>
      <li><h4>Biological Control:</h4> Explore the use of beneficial microorganisms or biocontrol agents that can help control Diplodia rot. Certain beneficial fungi, such as Trichoderma species, have shown potential in suppressing fungal pathogens.</li>
      <li><h4>Strengthen Plant Defense</h4>   Enhance the natural defense mechanisms of the trees by applying organic fertilizers, compost, and other soil amendments that promote healthy root development and overall plant vigor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.Leaf spot</h2>
    <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-fruit-crops/ipm-strategies-for-custard-apple/Leafspot.jpg" alt="Disease 1"> 
    <p>Leaf spot is a common fungal disease that affects custard apple trees. While there are several fungal pathogens that can cause leaf spot, the most common one is often referred to as Custard Apple Leaf Spot (Alternaria alternata).</p>
    <p>Remember, prevention and early intervention are key to managing leaf spot. By implementing proper cultural practices, practicing good sanitation, and using appropriate fungicides when necessary, you can help reduce the impact of leaf spot on custard apple trees.</p>
    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Circular or irregular spots on the leaves: The spots are typically brown or dark in color and may have a yellow halo around them.</li>
      <li>Lesions on the leaves: The spots may enlarge and coalesce, forming larger lesions on the leaves.
    </li>
      <li>Leaf yellowing and wilting: Severe infections can lead to leaf yellowing, wilting, and premature leaf drop.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected leaves, twigs, or fallen fruit from the vicinity of the tree. This reduces the source of infection and prevents the disease from spreading.</li>
      <li>Pruning: Prune and remove any heavily infected branches or leaves. This improves air circulation and sunlight penetration, creating unfavorable conditions for fungal growth.</li>
      <li>Organic Approaches: Organic control methods include applying organic fungicides or biofungicides approved for use in organic farming.</li>
      <li>Regular Monitoring: Regularly monitor the trees for any signs of leaf spot, especially during periods of high humidity or rainfall.</li>
    </ul>
